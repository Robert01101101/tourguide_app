A crossplatform Flutter app that helps users explore tours with navigation, information on places, and chat with an AI tourguide. A personal project currently in development.

## Design
- Main screens: Explore (find tours), AI Tourguide (Gemini-powered chatbot), Contribute (create tours), Profile (Settings etc).
- Tourguide has a focus on community content. Users can create tours, which are comprised of waypoints along with metadata for these waypoints.
- MVP includes text descriptions with tts, future additions might include things like voice recordings.
- MVP for tour guidance is a route displayed for the entire route, future additions might include things like waypoint-to-waypoint navigation.
- UX/UI designed in Figma (check GDoc for link).
- MVP largely uses platform default design (Material).
